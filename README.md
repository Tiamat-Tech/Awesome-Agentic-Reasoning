## 🌟 Introduction

Bridging thought and action through autonomous agents that reason, act, and learn via continual interaction with their environments. The goal is to enhance agent capabilities by grounding reasoning in action.

We organize agentic reasoning into three layers, each corresponding to a distinct reasoning paradigm under different *environmental dynamics*:

🔹 **Foundational Reasoning.** Core single-agent abilities (planning, tool-use, search) in environments

🔹 **Self-Evolving Reasoning.** Adaptation through feedback, memory, and learning in dynamic settings

🔹 **Collective Reasoning.** Multi-agent coordination, role specialization, and collaborative intelligence

Across these layers, we further identify complementary reasoning paradigms defined by their *optimization settings*.

🔸 **In-Context Reasoning.** Test-time scaling through structured orchestration and adaptive workflows

🔸 **Post-Training Reasoning.** Behavior optimization via RL and supervised fine-tuning
